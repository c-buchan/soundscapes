### Understanding the effects, mechanistic pathways, and constraints of soundscape complexity on mental well-being.

<hr />

Natural soundscapes are psychologically restorative, but we have a limited understanding of the acoustic properties of natural soundscapes that most benefit mental health and wellbeing, and generally a poor mechanistic understanding of how biodiversity impacts health. It is also unclear how the health benefits of natural soundscapes may be impacted by anthropogenic noise.

#### Key objectives

* Identify the acoustic properties of natural soundscapes that promote mental health and well-being in psychological experimental studies 
* Investigate the mediating pathways that underlie this effect
* Estimate whether anthropogenic noise (e.g. traffic) reduces the mental health and well-being potential of natural soundscapes.

<br />
*The psychology project theme is based at the University of Surrey, led by [Dr Ellie Ratcliffe](researchstaff.qmd#sec-psych) and [Dr Melissa Marselle](researchstaff.qmd#sec-psych) and investigated by [Dr Konrad Uebel](researchstaff.qmd#sec-psych).*
